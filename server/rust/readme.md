# Alternate Web Server - Rust

This server is an alternate to the Node server.  The plan is for this to be the primary server and replace the Node/Express option.

From the `server/rust` directory, build with
```
cargo build
```
then run the server with
```
cargo run
```
The server runs on `http://localhost:3003/`

## Todo
* https
* endpoints that do something
* Auth - just to try it out.
